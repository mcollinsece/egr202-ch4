# Savings Account Balance Program

Jacob Weinstein wants a program that displays his savings account balance at the end of the month, given the beginning balance, total deposits, and total withdrawals.

1. **Using the chart shown earlier in Figure 4-12 as a guide, enter the input, processing, and output items, as well as the algorithm, in the first column.**
2. **Desk-check the algorithm twice.**
   - For the first desk-check, use:
     - Beginning balance: 2545.75
     - Total deposits: 409.43
     - Total withdrawals: 210.65
   - For the second desk-check, use:
     - Beginning balance: 1125.33
     - Total deposits: 23
     - Total withdrawals: 800.94

3. **Enter the C++ instructions in the second column of the chart, and then desk-check the program using the same data used to desk-check the algorithm.**
4. **If necessary, create a new project named `Introductory11 Project`, and save it in the `Cpp8\Chap04` folder. Enter your C++ instructions into a source file named `Introductory11.cpp`. Also enter appropriate comments and any additional instructions required by the compiler. Test the program using the same data used to desk-check the program.**
